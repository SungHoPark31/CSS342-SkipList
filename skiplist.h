 Assignment4
 
 Description: In this program, we created a Skip List data structure to store integers.
 When searching a Skip List, items can be found in O(log n) time. No duplicates are allowed.
 A SkipList can have multiple levels. SkipList of depth 1 is similar to a doubly linked list. All
 elements are inserted into a single doubly linked list. When a SkipListhas multiple levels,
 all elements are inserted at level = 0. 50% of those inserted at level = 0, are also inserted
 at level = 1. 50% of those inserted at level = 1 are also inserted at level = 2, and so on.
